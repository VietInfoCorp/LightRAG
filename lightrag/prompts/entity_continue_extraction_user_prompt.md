---Task---
Continue extracting **missed** entities and relationships from the text.

---Instructions---
1.  **Focus on Details:** Look for specific parameters (speed, distance), equipment names (e.g., bypass pin), and sub-steps in procedures that might have been missed.
2.  **No Duplicates:** Do not repeat what was already extracted.
3.  **Format:** `entity<|#|>...` and `relation<|#|>...`.
4.  **Completion:** Output `{completion_delimiter}` as the final line.
